# PA3-Pantheon
# PA3: Pantheon Congestion Control Evaluation

This repository contains the results and analysis of **Programming Assignment 3 (PA3)** for the Computer Networks course. The experiments were conducted using **Pantheon** and **Mahimahi** to evaluate the performance of different congestion control schemes.

## ðŸ“Š Experiments Conducted

I tested the following congestion control algorithms:

- **BBR**
- **Cubic**
- **Vegas**

Under two network scenarios:

1. **Low latency, constrained bandwidth**  
   (50 Mbps, 10ms)
2. **High latency, high bandwidth**  
   (1 Mbps, 200ms)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Throughput**
- **Delay (95th percentile)**
- **Packet Loss Rate**
- **Utilization**

Each of these metrics is logged, summarized in CSVs, and visualized via plots.
